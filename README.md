# data-structures-project

The repository contains the example implementation and benchmarks for the following data structures:
 - array
 - linked list
 - stack (array-based and linked-list-based)
 - queue (array-based and linked-list-based)

The type of operations being measured is:
 - creation of a structure filled with data with a given size
 - insertion at a random index
 - deletion at a random index
 - searching for a value
